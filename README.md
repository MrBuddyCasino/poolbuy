# poolbuy.io

When this is done, people will be able to pool their orders to buy stuff in shops. This is great e.g. for electronic components, 
where there is often a substantial minimum order size. Target audience is the Arduino/Makerspace/RC crowd.

The whole thing is built with a Clojure backend and a Mithril frontend, which is similar to React. 
You can use html tags in your js, which is transformed via msx (similar to jsx) using the Gulp build pipeline.
